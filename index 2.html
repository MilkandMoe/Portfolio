    <p>This is Amilcar Cornier a self-taught developer who has learned HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript from reading books.
        I've been trying to learn these concepts. 
        I've been to and in time learning to code from The Tech Academy. Which in term teaches JavaScript. 
        This school has given me the knowledge to learn Object Oriented Programming and its overall
        fundamentals.

        morning everyday and doing coding and tutorials in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have my Bachelors in Science in

        position in this field. I have the knowledge and know how in computer software development. Love reading books in 
        development and attending Colorado Technical University Online. I started July 4 of 2017 is this endeavor and going

        started doing Javascript at The Tech Academy. A great school in-deed. My intentions is to get great at this! Employment
        job search has been difficult. But, The Tech Academy has given me the key to finding that position I need. Meanwhile, I have been studying Javascript

        getting and applying for a tech job will make me, but I intend to find a role. Everyday I respond to job search sites to make sure I open
        doors. Persistent and motivation is the way. I will graduate from the Tech Academy
