    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Ever since that I could think off. I needed a computer. One day I decided to do that it wasnt long after. 
       That I bought a Mac Apple Computer. Ever since then I wanted to use it to its full potential. So I decided to
       take class at Colorado Technical University Online for Computer Science. Which I did. Along the way I thought about
       branching out and take a technical approach in computer development. Waking up at earliest as possible to do some tutorials
       on JavaScript. Before doing this I read up on The Head First HTML and CSS book. I do know how to revert to HTML5 
       and CSS3. But JavaScript takes longer to grasp. My approach was to take class at The Tech Academy. This school is great
       and the curriculum is full of valuable information. Hope to better my overall knowledge in the Tech field. I need to put more time 
       into Version Control. So I am going to do that. Been viewing Mosh Hamedani tutorials on it. While attending to my classes. 
       Overall, I should be in good standing. My journey will continue....
